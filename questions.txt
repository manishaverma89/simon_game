 create a new Pattern

 // step-1 create a new function called nextSequence()

// step-2 Generate a new random number between 0 and 3, and store it in a variable called randomNumber

// step-3 create a new array called buttonColours and set it to hold the sequence "red", "blue", "green", "yellow"var

// step-4 Create a new variable called randomChosenColour and use the randomNumber from step 2 to select a random colour from the buttonColours array.

// step-5 create a new empty array called gamePattern

// step-6 Add the new randomChosenColour generated in step 4 to the end of the gamePattern.

         Show the Sequence to the User with Animations and Sounds

// step-7 Use jQuery to select the button with the same id as the randomChosenColour
// step-8 use jQuery to animate a flash to the button selected in step 7.
// step-9 figure out how you can use Javascript to play the sound for the button colour selected in step 7.

         Check Which Button is Pressed

// step-10  Use jQuery to detect when any of the buttons are clicked and trigger a handler function.
// step-11 Inside the handler, create a new variable called userChosenColour to store the id of the button that got clicked.
// step-12  At the top of this file, create a new empty array with the name userClickedPatter
// step-13 Add the contents of the variable userChosenColour created in step 11 to the end of this new userClickedPattern 

  At this stage, if you log the userClickedPattern you should be able to build up an array in the console by clicking on different buttons.

           
           Add Sounds to Button Clicks  

//step-14  In the same way we played sound in nextSequence() , when a user clicks on a button, the corresponding sound should be played. e.g if the Green button is clicked, then green.mp3 should be played.

//step-15 Create a new function called playSound() that takes a single input parameter called name.

//step-16 Take the code we used to play sound in the nextSequence() function and move it to playSound().

//step-17 Refactor the code in playSound() so that it will work for both playing sound in nextSequence() and when the user clicks a button.
